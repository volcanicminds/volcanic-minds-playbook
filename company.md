## A bit of history

Volcanic Minds was founded in September 2022 with the goal of providing high-quality services to partners and businesses alike.

Founded on the principle of delivering **smart**, **fast**, and **efficient** solutions, the company aims to stand out in the industry by offering not only technical services but also management and process optimization solutions.

Drawing on years of IT experience with Corporates, Startups, and SMEs, we identified the need for a truly reliable technological partner. As a young and dynamic firm, Volcanic Minds is poised to make a lasting impact in the IT consulting sector, driven by a clear mission.

## What drives us

Excellence is our cornerstone. Transparency is our method.
One ensures our solutions have a real impact; the other builds the trust required to achieve it together.

This approach allows us to transform our deep expertise - spanning industries from manufacturing and finance to automotive and healthcare — into tailored solutions. These values are the engine of our success, and we use them to build lasting impact together.

## Our north star

Our **Vision**: To be the most trusted architects of technological evolution, proving that exceptional growth is the natural result of a relentless focus on mutual success.

Our **Mission**: To be a launchpad for talent—a place where passion is fueled, potential is unlocked, and our team is our greatest achievement.

Our **Philosophy** is the foundation of our partnerships:

- **_Challenge_** Everything. Ask why. Find a better way, together.
- **_Collaborate_** to Win. Our victory is a shared one.
- **_Enjoy_** the Ascent. The journey matters as much as the summit.

## Rhythm of our culture

As a _fully remote_ company, connection is our lifeblood. We deliberately create a rhythm of rituals that unite us, spark creativity, and build a strong, supportive community across any distance.

We align through regular syncs where we share progress and shape innovative ideas. We grow through dedicated workshops that empower our team to master new skills and lead industry trends. Most importantly, we connect as people—through virtual events and celebrations that honor our achievements and forge genuine relationships.

These aren't just events on a calendar; they are the moments that define our culture and fuel our shared success.

## Partners in the center

We don't just have _clients_; we build **partnerships**. This is more than a choice of words. While a client relationship can be transactional, a partnership is built on a **shared destination**.

That’s why we invest the time to deeply understand our partners' vision, challenges, and goals. We don't just deliver solutions; we co-create them, embedding ourselves as a true extension of their team. This collaborative spirit is our engine for crafting winning strategies and ensuring that our growth is intrinsically linked to theirs.

## Innovative culture

For us, innovation isn't an initiative. It's our default state. It is the mindset that ensures every challenge is seen as an opportunity and every solution we build is designed not just for today, but for what comes next.

Our **approach** is built on three principles: 

1. Question the known with curiosity.
2. Build to learn through experimentation.
3. Deliver a decisive advantage.

## Methodology

We offer two primary engagement models, each designed to align with our partners' unique needs:

Our **Project-Based** focus model is for well-defined initiatives, ensuring crystal-clear scope, **timelines**, and deliverables. We co-create solutions as active partners, guaranteeing focused execution and exceptional quality from concept to completion. This model builds a foundation for **lasting impact**.

Our **Capacity-Based** model allows partners to **secure dedicated capacity in advance**, guaranteeing immediate, on-demand access to our expert team. Tailored for navigating workload peaks, critical validation phases, or evolving project requirements, this approach ensures continuous momentum and proactive support, free from the constraints of fixed project scopes and ensuring **resource readiness** when it matters most.

## Our expertise

At Volcanic Minds, our expertise is the crucible where **innovation meets impact**. We forge strategic advantages for our partners across a comprehensive range of disciplines:

- Project Orchestration
- UX/UI Design
- Software Engineering (Web, Mobile, SaaS Development)
- Cloud Architecture
- DevOps Automation
- Enterprise Integration
- AI Solutions
- Strategic & CIO/CTO Advisory

Attention to detail, maximum efficiency, and an innovative approach are among our strengths. We have a mobile-first approach to hybrid app development and an SEO-oriented approach to building digital solutions. We engineer scalable systems from the day one, without the need for large initial investments, yet ready to handle demanding workloads.

With over a decade of experience transforming complex challenges in banking, manufacturing, advertising, and citizen services, we deliver tangible success. This is the **Volcanic Minds** standard.

## Project journey

Every project is a **collaborative** journey designed for maximum impact. We follow a refined methodology, ensuring clarity and success from concept to completion:

- **Engage**: We begin to define vision, objectives, precise scope, timeline, and resources. This is where the blueprint for shared success takes shape.

- **Mockup**: Next, translate concepts into tangible prototypes or mockups, enabling early feedback and iterative refinement to confirm design and functionality.

- **Creation**: our expert teams orchestrate precise execution. We design, develop, and integrate all technical components (from software to infrastructure) ensuring adherence to specifications and a focus on agile delivery. We maintain radical transparency throughout, providing incremental progress updates and efficient change management. Continuous communication ensures unwavering alignment with partner expectations.

- **Evolution**: we manage seamless product launches, verify functionality, and provide ongoing support. We ensure continuous evolution, adapting solutions to changing needs and securing long-term value for our partners.

## Project meetings

At Volcanic Minds, we use the Scrum methodology to manage projects effectively. Scrum incorporates meetings and rituals that foster productive collaboration and deliver value to our clients. Some Scrum ceremonies are:

- **Planning**: The team convenes to determine tasks for the upcoming sprint. We review the product backlog—a prioritized list of features and requirements—and select items to address.

- **Daily Meetings**: Brief sessions held every day at the same time. Each team member provides a quick progress update and discusses any challenges, ensuring alignment and awareness. These daily touchpoints are crucial for maintaining momentum and quickly addressing any challenges.

- **Review**: At the end of each sprint, we demonstrate completed work to stakeholders and receive feedback, which helps refine the product backlog. By incorporating stakeholder feedback regularly, we identify and correct issues early, preventing them from persisting into subsequent stages of the project.

- **Retrospective**: The team reflects on the previous sprint to identify areas for improvement in our processes. This feedback directly affects the backlog.

By employing Scrum, we achieve a flexible and adaptive project management approach. Our team collaborates effectively to consistently deliver value, enhancing project efficiency, client satisfaction, and our ability to adapt to change.

## Project delivery kit

At the conclusion of every project, our commitment continues. We provide our clients and partners with comprehensive documentation detailing all the processes involved, along with the complete DevOps infrastructure setup if required. We also ensure that the source code is delivered to the client or partner upon receipt of payment.

We transfer our project knowledge, helping clients understand the development process, providing future reference, and identifying improvement areas for subsequent projects.

In essence, the handover process isn't just about delivering the source code—we provide all related knowledge and materials. We are dedicated to ensuring our clients have full control over their projects and understand every aspect of the development. Our goal is to enable clients to maintain and adapt their projects according to future goals.

## Effective meetings

To ensure productive meetings, it is essential to establish rules that apply to all participants, including partners and colleagues. Meetings should be held between 09:30 and 12:30, and between 14:30 and 17:30. As a fully remote company, participants are expected to keep their cameras on and be punctual.

Only essential personnel should be invited, with attendees informed of the topics discussed via summary emails when appropriate. This avoids wasting time and ensures that only those who can contribute attend.

Meetings should not exceed 50 minutes. Participants must come well-prepared and informed about the topics to be discussed.

Finally, it is crucial to conclude each meeting by sharing established goals or a list of topics for future meetings. By following these guidelines, all participants can ensure productive and efficient meetings.

## Define boundaries

Defining the boundaries of a project is essential to determine its specifications and protect the client's interests, ensuring we work towards the right objectives.

It’s not an easy task, but we consistently apply this validation throughout the project. Even if our clients have a clear idea of what they want to achieve, it’s our job to analyze and validate these boundaries, providing an external perspective.

## Timesheet

At Volcanic Minds, we believe in trust and autonomy in managing workload. We do not require employees to fill out timesheets unless requested by the client or if stipulated in the contract.

We encourage employees to communicate openly with their manager about any requests, questions, or concerns regarding time tracking.

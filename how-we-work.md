## Methodology

We offer two engagement models, each designed to align with our partners' unique needs:

Our **Project-Based** model is for well-defined initiatives, ensuring clear scope, **timelines**, and deliverables. We co-create solutions as active partners, guaranteeing focused execution and exceptional quality from concept to completion. This model builds a foundation for **lasting impact**.

Our **Capacity-Based** model allows partners to **secure dedicated capacity in advance**, ensuring immediate, on-demand access to our expert team. Tailored for workload peaks or evolving requirements, this approach provides continuous momentum and proactive support, ensuring **resource readiness** when it matters most.

## Our expertise

Our expertise is the crucible where **innovation meets impact**. We forge strategic advantages for our partners across a comprehensive range of disciplines:

- Project Orchestration
- UX/UI Design
- Software Engineering (Web, Mobile, SaaS Development)
- Cloud Architecture
- DevOps Automation
- Enterprise Integration
- AI Solutions
- Strategic & CIO/CTO Advisory

We engineer scalable, SEO-optimized, mobile-first systems from day one, minimizing initial investments while prepared for demanding workloads. 

Backed by over a decade of diverse experience across banking, manufacturing, advertising, and citizen services, we deliver tangible success. This is the **Volcanic Minds** standard.

## Project journey

Every project is a **collaborative** journey designed for maximum impact. We follow a refined methodology, ensuring clarity and success from concept to completion:

- **Engage**: We define vision, objectives, scope, timeline, and resources. This is the blueprint for shared success.

- **Mockup**: Next, translate concepts into tangible prototypes or mockups, enabling early feedback and iterative refinement to confirm design and functionality.

- **Creation**: Our expert teams orchestrate precise execution, designing, developing, and integrating all technical components. We ensure agile delivery and maintain radical transparency through incremental updates and efficient change management.

- **Evolution**: We manage seamless product launches, verify functionality, and provide ongoing support. We ensure continuous evolution, adapting solutions to changing needs for long-term value.

## Project meetings

We leverage Scrum to manage projects effectively, ensuring transparent collaboration and continuous value delivery through key ceremonies:

- **Planning**: The team determines tasks for the upcoming sprint, reviewing and selecting items from stakeholders and the product backlog.

- **Daily Meetings**: Brief, daily sessions where each team member provides quick progress updates and discusses challenges, maintaining momentum.

- **Review**: At sprint end, we demonstrate completed work to stakeholders and receive feedback, which refines the product backlog and identifies issues early.

- **Retrospective**: The team reflects on the previous sprint to identify process improvements, directly impacting the backlog.

Our team collaborates effectively to consistently deliver value, enhancing project efficiency, client satisfaction, and our ability to adapt to change.

## Project delivery kit

Our commitment extends beyond delivery. Upon project conclusion, if required, we provide comprehensive documentation of processes, the devOps infrastructure setup and source code upon payment.

We transfer all project knowledge, ensuring partners have full control, understanding, and the ability to maintain and adapt their solutions according to future goals.

## Effective meetings

Productive meetings require adherence to clear guidelines for all participants, partners and colleagues alike:

*   Meetings should be held between 09:30-12:30 and 14:30-17:30.
*   As a fully remote company, participants are expected to keep cameras on and be punctual.
*   Only essential personnel should be invited, informed via summary emails when appropriate.
*   Meetings should not exceed 90 minutes, with participants well-prepared.
*   Conclude each meeting by sharing established goals or topics for future discussions.

## Define boundaries

Defining project boundaries is crucial for precise specifications and protecting partner interests. We consistently validate these boundaries throughout the project, providing an external perspective to ensure alignment with true objectives.

## Timesheet

At Volcanic Minds, we believe in trust and autonomy in managing workload. We do not require collaborators to fill out timesheets unless requested by the partner or if stipulated in the contract.

We encourage collaborators to communicate openly with their manager about any requests, questions, or concerns regarding time tracking.

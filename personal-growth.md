## Hiring process

Our hiring process is guided by **inclusivity**, **transparency**, and **fairness**. We apply a rigorous five-step approach to ensure these goals:

1.  **Application Submission**: Candidates apply via email, our website, social media, or job boards.
2.  **Screening Call**: Initial assessment of interest, experience, and qualifications.
3.  **Tech Interview**: Evaluation of skills and experience. In some cases, this may be combined with the screening call.
4.  **Tech Test**: Further assessment of abilities. We provide clear instructions and guidelines for the test and offer support if needed.
5.  **Job Offer**: Finally, extension of an offer with comprehensive perks and benefits to join our team.

We maintain clear and transparent communication throughout, committed to fair and equitable treatment for all applicants.

## Onboarding, Coaching & Follow Up

Our onboarding process equips new team members with the knowledge, tools, and understanding of our methods, technologies, and vision to ensure a strong start and shared commitment to growth. We make sure all essential information is clear, leaving no room for confusion.

We see our team as our greatest asset, and we’re committed to ongoing coaching and support to foster both personal and professional growth. When our people thrive, so does the company.

Beyond professional development, we value work-life balance and mental well-being. We encourage team members to set their own growth goals and collaborate with managers to achieve them.

## Career path

Volcanic Minds offers three career paths: marketing and design, IT development, and administration and sales.

-   **Marketing and Design**: Operatives manage specific projects, while Team Leaders coordinate teams for dedicated clients or multiple assignments.
-   **IT Development**: Teams (Frontend, Backend, QA and so on) are led by Team Leaders, focusing on specific projects, internal core initiatives, or diverse assignments.
-   **Administration and Sales**: Administrative team manage internal operations, and Sales team operate with Salespeople and Team Leaders, often focusing on specific industries, partners, or enterprise clients.

We offer clear opportunities for growth from operative to team leadership, and then to higher management. While career progression may not always be linear in our dynamic environment, we provide avenues for increased responsibility and skill development. We encourage dedication, a willingness to learn, and alignment with our values, building trust among colleagues and leaders.

## Remote working

Volcanic Minds operates as a fully remote organization, fostering trust and efficiency. Team members work from their preferred location, maintaining availability within a specific time zone range (no more than one hour ahead or behind company official time). This ensures collaborative hours while offering scheduling flexibility.

We champion a flexible environment that enhances work-life balance and productivity. While primarily remote, we value and are open to organizing strategic in-person meetings for team-building, training, and company celebrations, with decisions made collaboratively and in the team's best interest.

## Personal tech budget & benefits

We understand technology is fundamental to our work. To ensure our team is equipped, we offer a personal tech budget and comprehensive benefits:

-   **Tech Budget**: Senior employees (2+ years) receive a renewed budget every two years for devices (laptops, smartphones, tablets). Newer team members are provided all necessary tools, including laptops and software.

Additionally, our team enjoys:

-   **Work Flexibility**: Remote work and paid time off support work-life balance.
-   **Software & Subscriptions**: Access to professional tools, with openness to new proposals.
-   **Professional Opportunities**: Access to tech events, training programs, and workshops for skill development.
-   **Meal Vouchers**: Convenience and flexibility for daily meals.

Our aim is to create a supportive environment that enables effective performance and fosters both personal and professional growth.

## Investment Time: open source, reading, e-learning

We champion personal and professional growth, encouraging our team to dedicate ~8 hours monthly to development and well-being activities. This includes **open-source contributions**, **reading** to deepen knowledge, **physical activities** for health, and **e-learning** to expand skills. This investment enables our team to bring their best selves, driving innovation and building a more resilient, successful company that positively impacts our partners.

## Life balancing: free-paid time

We support a healthy work-life balance with a mix of paid and unpaid time off, enhancing job satisfaction and mental health. We provide the following days for recharging:

-   **Birthdate**: An extra paid day off.
-   **Mental Health Day**: Two paid days off, usable in spring or autumn.
-   **San Giovanni**: June 24th, a paid day off (patron saint of Turin).
-   **Flexible Days**: Up to three unpaid days off for personal development, cultural activities, or volunteering.

Employees are asked to plan these days in advance with their manager to ensure seamless operations with partners and colleagues.

## Leave days, vacation days

Company vacation days are a crucial benefit. We adhere to legal requirements, ensuring all team members receive their entitled leave. Recognizing diverse needs, we do not mandate specific vacation periods. 

Instead, we encourage advanced planning and collaboration with direct managers to align with business needs. Transparency and flexibility are our guiding principles, fostering a supportive work environment.

## Parting ways

Parting ways is tough but sometimes necessary. We aim to create a positive work environment, but when separation is inevitable, open and honest discussions are crucial to explore solutions. If it is the best option, it must be handled professionally and empathetically, with respect and dignity for the departing collaborator. Always discuss transparently with your manager first.

**Resignation**: When an collaborator decides to leave, we handle it professionally, respecting their decision. We encourage open communication to understand reasons, provide support, ensure smooth knowledge transfer, conduct exit interviews for feedback, and maintain positive relationships for future collaborations. Adequate notice, per company policy and legal requirements, is necessary.

**Termination**: The most serious form of separation, reserved for serious misconduct, poor performance, or policy violations. It is handled with professionalism, empathy, sensitivity, and fairness. All termination decisions are based on valid reasons and adhere to company policies and legal requirements. We maintain a respectful relationship with former collaborators and wish them well in their future endeavors.

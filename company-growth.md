## Growth strategy

Volcanic Minds is on a deliberate path of expansion. From empowering tech startups and SMEs to driving success for larger enterprises, our growth strategy is built on deepening our specialized service lines. 

This allows us to amplify existing partnerships and forge new ones, ensuring our evolution is intrinsically linked to the shared success of our entire ecosystem.

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals

As you probably know, SMART is a mnemonic acronym that can be used to drive the main objectives, which stands for ***S***_pecific_ ***M***_easurable_ ***A***_chievable_ ***R***_easonable_ ***T***_ime-bound_.

Strategic goals:

- Enhance website presence through various online strategies.
- Diversify revenue streams by customer type and sector.
- Implement and expand AI-related projects.
- Strengthen and expand internship and co-ops.
- Leverage open source projects for partner initiatives.
- Explore and enter new international markets.
- Establish new alliances in complementary sectors.
- Increase overall sales and revenue.

## Work for equity

While our primary focus is **service delivery**, we view strategic equity ventures as a powerful tool for **mutual growth**. We actively explore and invest in ambitious projects, particularly during their evolutionary or maintenance phases. This allows us to forge deeper, mutually beneficial partnerships, especially with those seeking innovative financing solutions. 

Each opportunity is rigorously evaluated for clear alignment with our mission and a defined path to shared victory.

## Social projects & no-profit activities

We recognize the importance of giving back a portion of our success. This helps build a strong community, allows us to use our expertise for the greater good, and motivates our team by raising awareness on various social issues.

If you have a project to propose, please reach out to us. We will evaluate it together. More information on how to contact us can be found [here](https://playbook.volcanicminds.com/contact-us#how-to-ask-us-to-become-your-sponsor).
